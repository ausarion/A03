What is Git, Webstorm and How to use Github? Tutorial!!!

Git is a Distributed Version Control tool that is used to store different versions of a file in a remote or local repository. It is used to track changes in the source code. It allows multiple developers to work together.

Webstorm is a Integrated Development Environment(IDE) text editor, considered to be the smartest
Javascript text editor for most popular framework; Web, Mobile, Server and Desktop.
I haven't had a chance to experience working inside Webstorm, but Spring Semester of 2019, I got the 
oppportunity to work with "Atom" another text editor for the first time. The experience was enlighten
and encouraging to continue to learn more about other text editors. I was a part of class Project, that 
created our first Android App using "Atom." In my first year at NJIT, I learned about Git and Github in CS100.
I found it intriguing that you can collaborate with others during the process of developing a Android App using 
Github. Every team member has a chance and an obligation to "Commit and Contribute", to be a part of a innovating
project that is beneficial for internship programs or future employment.


#Step 1.Install Git and Create an account on Github
@https://git-scm.com/
@https://github.com/

What is Github? Github is code hosting platform for source
version control and collaboration for accessing files so
developers can share file version changes.

#Step 2.
Create a New local git repository

What is a repository? A place where code, ideas and resources 
can be stored and shared.

a.Go to site an create an account
b.In the top right corner click on the "+" icon
  and select New repository
c.Choose a name for your repository and write a 
  brief description of project.
d.Initialize the repository with the README and 
  click "Create repository."
  
#Step 3.Next Create a "Branch"

What is a Branch? A way to work on "diffs" or different version of a
repository at one time. By default the repository has one branch
named "master", which is the definitive branch. Branch's are used to
experiment and make edits before committing them to committing them
to "master."

To create a new Branch
a.Go to your new repository and click down
  at the top of the file list that says branch:master
b.Type readme-edits into the new branch text box
c.Select the blue Create branch box and click "Enter"
  on your keyboard
  
#Step 4.Make and Commit changes

What are Commits? Commits are saved changes that are documented changes
place in commit messages, with a description explaining the changes made,
commit keep track of changes.

To make and commit changes
a.Click on the pencil icon in the upper right corner
   of the file view edit.
b.Write a brief message about yourself. Then write a commit message
 that describes the changes.
c.Then click "Commit changes" button, changes will made
  in the readme-edits file, in this branch content will
  be different from "master."
  
#Step 5. Open a Pull Request

 What is a Pull request? Pull Request are the main collaboration
 on Github.
 When you Pull request, you are proposing changes to be
 reviewed and pull into contribution, and merged into their
 branch. Pull request displays the differences of content fom both 
 branches.
 "Added" changes are in green and "subtracted" changes are in red.
 You can Pull request after commit and begin discussion.
 By adding @mention system your Pull request message can be ask for feedback
 from team members,specific people or developers.
 
 You can also Open Pull request in your own repository and merge them
 yourself.
 
 To do a Open Pull request
 a.Click on the icon that says Pull request tab.
   then click the new Pull request.
 b.In the Ex.Comparison box where you create the readme-edits
   to compare with "master"(the original)
 c.View the changes in the "diffs" on the Compare page
   be sure you want to submit. Once viewed and satisfied
   to submit, click Create Pull request button.
 d.Then Title it with a brief description of changes.
 
 #Final Step Merge your Pull request
 
 All changes come together in readme-edits branch into the
 "master" branch.
 
 Click the green Merge pull rewuest button to
 merge chenages into "master".
 
 Confirm Merge!
 
 Definition of  reamaining Terms:
 
 Clone- Cloning a repository means that you're downloading a copy of the source code from source control.
 Push- Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub.
 Merge Conflict- Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to 
 decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge, usually on different lines or files which makes merging easy for 
 computer understand.
 Fetch- just "downloads" the changes from the remote to your local repository.
 Remote- A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such 
 a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server. In contrast the local 
 repository, a remote does not show the file tree of project current state.
